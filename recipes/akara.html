    <h1>AKARA BEANS RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/akara.png" alt="Akara beans recipe">
    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>Akara is a popular West African dish, particularly enjoyed in Nigeria, Ghana, and surrounding countries. It is made from black-eyed peas (or sometimes other types of beans), which are soaked, peeled, and blended into a smooth batter. The batter is seasoned with spices, onions, and occasionally peppers to add flavor. The mixture is then deep-fried into small, round, or oblong fritters.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients Required to prepare Akara</h2>
    <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Black-eyed peas:2 cups (or any other type of beans, such as brown beans).</li>
        <li>Onion: 1 medium-sized (chopped or blended).</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet pepper (or any chili): 1-2 pieces (adjust to taste).</li>
        <li>Salt: To taste.</li>
        <li>Water: As needed for blending.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Seasoning cubes: 1 small (optional, for extra flavor).</li>
        <li>Bell peppers: 1 small red or yellow (for a sweeter taste).</li>
        <li>Garlic: 1 clove (optional, for added depth of flavor).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Frying</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil: Enough for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps Required to Prepare Akara</h2>
    <h3>Soak the Beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the black-eyed peas in water for about 1-2 hours (or overnight if you prefer). This softens the skin and makes peeling easier.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Peel the Beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skins by rubbing the beans between your palms. Rinse with water repeatedly to separate the skins from the beans.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Blend the Beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer the peeled beans into a blender. Add a little water (just enough to help with blending) and blend into a smooth, thick paste. Do not make it too watery.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Add Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>ransfer the blended paste into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix in the chopped onions, finely blended peppers, and salt (and any optional seasoning). Stir thoroughly to combine.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Whisk the Batter</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a whisk or spoon to mix the batter vigorously. This incorporates air, making the Akara fluffy when fried.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Frying Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Scoop spoonfuls of the batter and gently drop them into the hot oil. Fry in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook Evenly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the Akara fritters until golden brown, turning them occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Drain the Oil</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the Akara using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel to drain excess oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Serve hot with bread, pap, custard, or enjoy as a snack on its own.</li>
        <li>Pro Tip: Avoid making the batter too watery; a thick consistency yields better results.</li>
    </ol>
