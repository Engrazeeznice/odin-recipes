        <li>Scotch bonnet pepper (optional, for heat): 1 or 2</li>
        <li>Onions:1 medium</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: 2 medium (optional, depending on recipe variation)</li>
        <li>Ground crayfish: 1-2 tablespoons (optional for flavor)</li>
        <li>Ground pepper: to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (or palm oil for a richer taste): 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Salt: to taste</li>
        <li>Maggi or seasoning cubes: 1-2 (optional for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>Water: as needed to blend and adjust consistency</li>
        <li>Boiled eggs: 2-3 (optional, sliced for adding into the mixture)</li>
        <li>Fish (such as mackerel, optional, flaked or whole pieces): 1/2 cup or more for flavor (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps Required to Prepare Moi Moi</h2>
    <h3>Soak the Beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the black-eyed peas (or brown beans) in water for about 2-3 hours to soften them. This will make it easier to peel them.</li>
        <li>After soaking, peel off the skins. You can do this by rubbing the beans between your palms in water, or by using a blender to help remove the skins.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Blend the Beans</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the peeled beans into a blender along with onions, red bell pepper, scotch bonnet pepper (if using), tomatoes (optional), and a little water.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth. The consistency should be thick but pourable (add water as needed, but do not make it too runny).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Flavoring</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the ground crayfish, ground pepper, and Maggi or seasoning cubes. You can also add some salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Add vegetable oil (or palm oil if you want a richer taste) to the blended mixture.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mix and Adjust</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the blended ingredients thoroughly to combine everything evenly. You can taste and adjust seasoning at this point (add more salt or seasoning cubes if needed).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Add Fillings (Optional)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you want to add boiled eggs, slice them into rings or halves, and stir them into the mixture.</li>
        <li>If using fish, flake it into small pieces and add it to the batter as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare Steaming Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you're using Moi Moi molds, lightly oil them to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>If you don’t have molds, you can use banana leaves to wrap individual portions. Cut the banana leaves into square or rectangular pieces and lightly oil them.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pour the Mixture into Molds/Leaves</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the batter into the molds or onto the center of the banana leaves, folding them to form a packet around the mixture.</li>
        <li>If you're using molds, fill them about halfway so the Moi Moi can expand as it cooks.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steam the Moi Moi</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the filled molds or wrapped banana leaves into a steamer or a large pot with a steaming rack. Ensure that there's enough water at the bottom of the pot to generate steam.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a lid and steam on medium heat for about 45-60 minutes or until the Moi Moi is firm to the touch and has a slightly glossy appearance on top.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Check for Doneness</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To check if the Moi Moi is cooked, insert a toothpick or fork into the center; it should come out clean when done.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the Moi Moi from the molds or banana leaves, allow to cool slightly, and serve with rice, pap, or on its own.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade Moi Moi</li>
    </ol>
